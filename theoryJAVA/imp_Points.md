-  Why can‚Äôt you declare a method inside main() in Java?
    - Java is a statically-typed, block-structured, class-based language.
    - Methods are members of a class ‚Äî not of other methods.
    - A method definition must exist at the class level, not nested inside another method. 

            void sayHello() {
                System.out.println("Hello!");
            }

    - defining a method.üëÜ
    - But in Java:   
      You can call methods inside methods.  
     ` You cannot declare methods inside methods ‚Äî because Java's syntax and memory model are not designed to handle nested method scopes.`

     - if you try it, u would get `error: illegal start of expression`
- Why?  
    - Because the Java compiler only expects statements (like int x = 5;, sayHello();, if(...) {...} etc.) inside a method.  
    - A method definition is not a statement ‚Äî it belongs to the class body, not inside a method body.

        public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                sayHello();
            }

            static void sayHello() {
                System.out.println("Hello!");
            }
        }

    What you wanted	Java equivalent   
    Method inside main--------------------- ‚ùå Not allowed  
    Anonymous class inside main------------ ‚úÖ Yes  
    Lambda inside main (Java 8+)----------- ‚úÖ Yes

- ‚öôÔ∏è But other languages allow this‚Ä¶  
    Yes!  
    Languages like Python and JavaScript allow function definitions inside functions because:  

    Their runtime environments are more dynamic.  

    Functions are first-class citizens (they can be created, passed, and returned like any other value).

    Their scoping and memory models are built to support this.
